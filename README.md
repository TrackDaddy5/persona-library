Persona Library — Repository Description

The Persona Library is a structured collection of modular, reusable AI personas designed to support complex workflows, decision‑making, and technical problem‑solving. Each persona is written as a self‑contained specification that defines:

- Role & domain expertise
- Communication style
- Operating principles
- Constraints & boundaries
- Activation phrases
- System‑behavior expectations

The goal of the library is to provide consistent, predictable, high‑quality AI behavior across different tasks, machines, and environments. By storing personas in version control, the library becomes portable, maintainable, and easy to evolve over time.

What the Persona Library Enables

1. Repeatable AI behavior
Each persona acts like a “mode” or “operating profile” you can activate on demand.
2. Clean separation of concerns
Personas are organized by domain (e.g., lending, negotiation, IT support, legal reasoning), making it easy to switch contexts without cognitive drift.
3. Versioned improvements
Changes to personas can be tracked, reviewed, and rolled back using Git.
4. Portability across machines
Because the library lives in GitHub, you can clone it onto any system and instantly regain your full persona toolkit.
5. Documentation of your workflows
Each persona doubles as a form of documentation — a written record of how you want the AI to behave in specific scenarios.
