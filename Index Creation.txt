INDEX REBUILD BLOCK (MASTER VERSION)
---------------------------------------

Version: 1.0  
Purpose: Rebuild the entire Index if deleted.  
Scope: Contains full system architecture, commands, rules, and structure.  
Excludes: Persona text (stored in separate persona blocks).

=======================================
0.0 PURPOSE OF THE INDEX
=======================================
The Index is the authoritative control center for:
- Persona library
- System architecture
- Commands
- Thread lifecycle rules
- Versioning
- Rebuild instructions

It ensures modularity, portability, and clean context across all devices and locations.

=======================================
1.0 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
=======================================
The system is built on four pillars:

1. PERSONAS  
   - Stored separately in dedicated blocks  
   - Recalled on demand  
   - Never embedded directly in the Index  

2. COMMANDS  
   - Universal, persona‑agnostic  
   - Short, verb‑driven  
   - Used to control context, navigation, and output  

3. THREAD LIFECYCLE  
   - Rules for starting, maintaining, and closing threads  
   - Ensures clean context and prevents drift  

4. VERSIONING  
   - Every persona and system component has a version  
   - Updates are modular and isolated  

=======================================
1.1 PERSONA REFERENCES
=======================================
Personas are NOT stored inside the Index.  
They are referenced here and stored in separate blocks.

Current personas:

- VBA Persona V2  
  (See separate VBA Persona Block)

- VHA Persona V4  
  (See separate VHA Persona Block)

Future persona slots (placeholders):
- Finance Persona  
- Property / Snowbird Logistics Persona  
- Woodworking Persona  
- Smart Home / NUC Persona  
- Outlook / Alias Architecture Persona  
- Government Navigator Persona  
- AI Prompt Engineer Persona  

=======================================
2.0 NAMING CONVENTIONS
=======================================
- Personas use: [Name] Persona V[number]  
- Index uses: Index Rebuild Block (Master Version)  
- Commands use: Verb + Object (e.g., “Recall Persona”)  
- Threads use: [Persona] — [Topic]  

=======================================
3.0 VERSIONING RULES
=======================================
- Each persona evolves independently.  
- Index version changes only when architecture changes.  
- Persona updates do NOT require Index updates.  
- Version numbers increase only on meaningful changes.

2. Paste the VBA Persona Block.  
3. Paste the VHA Persona Block.
